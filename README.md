# 📈 AI Stock Portfolio Analyst (Astron Agent Workflows)

This repository contains two powerful financial analysis workflows built for **Astron Agent**. These agents act as an autonomous research team, capable of analyzing market sentiment, fundamental health, and systemic risks for any public company.

## 📂 Included Workflows

### 1. 🚀 Extended Stock Portfolio (Autonomous)
*The "Pro" version. Fully automated from ticker to final report.*

This workflow is designed for complete automation. You simply provide a company name, and the agent handles the rest.

**Key Features:**
* **Smart Stock Extraction:** Uses an LLM to identify tickers from natural language (e.g., "Tell me about Apple" → `AAPL`). Includes a logic loop to ask for clarification if no stock is found.
* **Parallel Processing:** simultaneously runs three distinct research branches to save time:
    1.  **News Aggregator:** Searches for the latest headlines and social sentiment (Reddit/X).
    2.  **Fundamental Analyst:** Retrieves hard financial metrics (P/E, Revenue, Earnings).
    3.  **Risk Assessor:** Scans for "negative" keywords like lawsuits, regulatory probes, and leadership scandals.
* **Automated Scraping:** Uses Python (via Jina AI) to visit search results and extract full article text for deep analysis.
* **Synthesis:** Merges all data into a professional "Buy/Hold/Sell" executive summary.

**Best for:** Users who want a daily automated briefing without manually searching for news.

### 2. 📝 Stock Portfolio (Manual Input)
*The "Lite" version. Human-in-the-loop analysis.*

This workflow focuses purely on the **analysis logic** without the external searching.

**How it works:**
* The agent asks you to paste specific text (e.g., a news article, an earnings report, or a rumor).
* It analyzes the text using the same specialized prompts (Sentiment, Fundamentals, Risk).
* It generates a report based strictly on the data you provided.

**Best for:** Users without API keys, or when you want to analyze a specific document/email that is not public on the web.

    * **Body Parameter:** `q` (The search query).

### 2. Web Scraper (Python Node)
Used to read the content of the found URLs.
